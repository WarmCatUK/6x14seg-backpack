This backpack consists of a 6-digit alphanumeric display, driven by the HT16K33. 
Connection to the Arduino is simple, with just two wires (SDA & SCL), in addition to power and ground.
A separate pin "Vi2c" is provided should you wish to drive the logic at a different voltage to the display; for most uses this can just be linked with VDD.

Up to 8 of these backpacks can be daisychained by soldering the address jumpers.
